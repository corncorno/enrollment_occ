# Data Flow Diagram - Context Diagram (Level 0)

## Overview
The Context Diagram represents the highest level view of the OCC Enrollment System, showing the system as a single process and its interactions with external entities.

## System Boundary
The OCC Enrollment System manages the complete student enrollment lifecycle from initial registration through graduation, including curriculum management, enrollment processing, document verification, grade management, and reporting.

## External Entities

1. **Student** - Primary user who registers, applies for enrollment, uploads documents, views schedules and grades
2. **Admin/Registrar** - System administrator who manages users, curriculum, sections, schedules, approves enrollments, generates CORs, and manages grades
3. **Admission Officer** - Handles applicant processing, document verification, student number assignment, and enrollment control
4. **Program Head** - Submits curriculum proposals for their respective programs
5. **Dean** - Reviews and approves curriculum submissions, views enrollment reports
6. **Registrar Staff** - Assists with enrollment processes and administrative tasks

## Notes

- The Context Diagram shows the system as a single black box
- All external entities are shown as rectangles
- Data flows are bidirectional where appropriate
- The system handles authentication for all user types
- All data flows represent logical data, not physical implementation details
